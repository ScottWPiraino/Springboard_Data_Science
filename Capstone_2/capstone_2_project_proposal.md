I plan to work on the problem proposed by the [Web Traffic Time Series Forcasting](https://www.kaggle.com/c/web-traffic-time-series-forecasting) Kaggle competition, which involves predicting future web visits to wikipedia pages. Potential clients for this include companies that conduct their business on the internet. For example, this competition is hosted by Google, suggesting an interest in this problem. The data that I will use for this includes the data already available on Kaggle, which includes historical time series of visits to wikipeida pages. Consistent with the rules of the competition, I may also seek to use other sources of external data that might be useful. I plan to use machine learning technqiues that are useful for time series prediction to develop a model that predicts well on future unseen times. The deliverables for this will include code as well as a write up of the work that I have done.
