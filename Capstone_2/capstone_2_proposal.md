2. [Web traffic time series forcasting](https://www.kaggle.com/c/web-traffic-time-series-forecasting)  
  
3. A reinforcement learning project. I'm open to ideas about what specifically to do using reinforcement learning. One possiblity is [this competition](https://www.crowdai.org/challenges/nips-2017-learning-to-run).  
  
4. I've recently become interesting in a class of machine learning problems that goes under names of meta-learning/transfer learning/learning to learn. Previously we had discussed the possiblity of trying to implement ideas from papers. I've been reading several papers in this space including [this one](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06636) and [this one](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03400). I would be interested in implementing/extending/combining the ideas from these papers, although I would need to find some domain to apply these to.
